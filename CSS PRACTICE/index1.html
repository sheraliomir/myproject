    width="300" height="250"> Radiohead's musical style has been described as art rock,[30] alternative rock,[235] electronica,[238] experimental rock,[241] progressive rock,[232] Britpop,[232] grunge,[232] art pop,[242] and electronic rock.[243] Joe Taysom of Far Out referred to Radiohead technically as a stadium rock band.[244] Among Radiohead's earliest influences were Queen,[245] Bob Dylan,[245] Pink Floyd and Elvis Costello, post-punk acts such as Joy Division,[245] Siouxsie and the Banshees[245][246] and Magazine, and significantly 1980s alternative rock bands such as R.E.M.,[245] U2, the Pixies, the Smiths and Sonic Youth.[247] Jonny Greenwood named Magazine guitarist John McGeoch his biggest guitar influence.[248] By the mid-1990s, Radiohead began to adopt recording methods from hip hop, inspired by the sampling work of DJ Shadow,[2] and became interested in using computers to generate sounds.[249] Other influences include the soundtracks of Ennio Morricone, 1960s rock groups such as the Beatles and the Beach Boys, and Phil Spector's "wall of sound" production.[2][31]
Radiohead have cited 60s and 70s jazz artists such as Miles Davis, Charles Mingus and Alicer Coltrane as influences.[250] According to Jonny Greenwood, "We bring in our favourite jazz albums, and say: we want to do this. And we enjoy the sound of our failing!"[250] He likened their jazz influence to 1950s English bands imitating American blues records.[250] Drummer Clive Deamer, who has recorded and performed with Radiohead since 2011, said Radiohead do not see themselves as a rock band and that their methodology had closer parallels with jazz: "They deliberately try to avoid clich√© and standard forms for the sake of the song ... Rock bands don't do that. It's far more like a jazz mentality."</p>
